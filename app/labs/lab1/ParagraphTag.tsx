        This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set of sentences with
        vertical spaces to make the text easier to read. Browsers ignore
        vertical white spaces and render all the text as one single set of
        sentences. To force the browser to add vertical spacing, wrap the
        paragraphs you want to separate with the paragraph tag
      </p>
      <p id="wd-p-2">
        This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
        vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
      </p>
      <p id="wd-p-3">
        This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
        gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
        browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
        the right.
      </p>
      <p id="wd-p-4">
        This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
        tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
      </p>
      <p id="wd-ai-p">
        Browsers collapse the blank lines and extra spaces in the source file,
        so text typed as separate blocks still renders as one run of
        sentences. The paragraph tag marks each block as its own element, and
        the browser gives that element default top and bottom margins, which
        is what shows up as the vertical gap.
